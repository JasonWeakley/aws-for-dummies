#Hosting a Vanity URL with AWS
AWS does provide tutorials for how to host and launch your application with your own custom/vanity URL. Below are my own notes about my experience going through this process.

[Setting Up a Static Website Using a Custom Domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)

In Step 3.1 there is a lot of information that I strongly recommend you read through. If you have ever registered a domain before, or changed nameservers for hosting your website some of this will be familiar to you, but the AWS tutorial here has a lot of information that is worth knowing. I don't fully understand all of it myself, but the more you know about how applications are actually served to the public will not hurt you. Its like driving a car. You might know how to open the door, turn the key and drive to work, but you also need to know about tag and title registration, how and where to get a driver's license, and how to transfer ownership of the car, because eventually you will get another car. Being a user of a website is one thing, owning one is another. Same goes for websites.

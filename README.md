#Documenting my Experiences with AWS
This repository is dedicated to documenting my experiences learning how to use AWS to host applications. My goal is to learn how to host multiple websites using a single AWS account, moving away from cPanel providers like HostGator.
My hope is that my experiences will encourage other developers like myself, specifically those who are or have been students at Nashville Software School to try AWS for themselves.
Amazon does provide many tutorials for beginners, and my documentation is meant to help supplement these where content from AWS may be outdated or lacking in some way, and how I tailored my AWS services to suit my needs.
